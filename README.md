#Cards
## About
This is a simple implementation of a playing card API. Applications should be
able to use this API play arbitrary cards games.

Cards API was inspired by Chase Roberts' [Deck of Cards
API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/). You can check out Chase's implementation
[here](https://github.com/crobertsbmw/deckofcards).
